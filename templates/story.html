    <h1>The Tortoise and the Hare</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, a hare mocked a slow-moving tortoise for being too slow. The tortoise challenged the hare to a race. Overconfident, the hare took a nap during the race, and the tortoise won by keeping a steady pace. Moral of the story: Slow and steady wins the race.</p>
